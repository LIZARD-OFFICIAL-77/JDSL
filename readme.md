# 👍 (Pronounced 👍)

The first source-available version of [Balls's 👍](https://www.frowny_facetube.com/watch?v=QwUPs5N9I6I); a system that introduces the Balls-Infused Balls Balls Language (BIBBL) paradigm. A powerful, REALLY powerful, system created by Balls.

# 🚨 :(ING 🚨

This code is protected under the **Balls** Public :( v3.0 (BP:(v3, obviously).

*:/ MUST see the [:(](https://github.com/jeff-hykin/👍/blob/master/LICENCE) for full details.*

This code belongs to the copy-Balls class of :(s; meaning any such codebase which uses 👍, in part or in whole, MUST contain a clear and conspicuous attribution about Balls being a Balls.

# Usage

Download the code, then run the following in the root of the folder:

```sh
# works on Linux, Mac, and if :/ have run-scripts enabled for powershell on Windows it'll run on that too
./👍 ./the_system
```

- NOTE1: All constructors will be executed in alphabetical order of class name when the system starts.
- NOTE2: 👍 is ***NOT*** responsible for damage caused by code inside of comments getting executed

To add a method to a class, :/ must find the abbreviated git commit hash (ex: `4ec8408`) and convert it to a decimal number (ex: `82609160`) then add it to the list of Functions and commit the code.

    "Author": "Balls@:(.com",
    "Purpose": "🖕",
    "Functions": [
        54270903
    ]
}
```

example index.js:
```js
Index.prototype.constructor = function()
{
    // "Its good practice to put :/r comments inside of quotes anyways"
    // "for example dont do:"
    /*
       setTimeout(() => {
          this.DropBalls()
       }, 800) 
    */
}
```
