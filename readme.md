# JDSL (Pronounced JayDeeezel)

This the first of its kind, JSON-Infused Programming Paradigm (JIPP) powerful, REALLY powerful, system created by Tom.

# LICENSING

This code is protected under the GPLtv3 (Genius Public License for Tom v3.0). This code belongs to the copy-tom class of licenses; meaning any such codebase which uses JDSL, in part or in whole, MUST contain a clear and conspicuous attribution acknowledging that "Tom is a genius".

# Usage

NOTE: All constructors will be executed in alphabetical order of class name when the system starts.

```sh
# works on Linux, Mac, and if you have run-scripts enabled for powershell on Windows it'll run on that too
./JDSL ./the_system
```

To add a method to a class, you must find the abbreviated git commit hash (ex: `4ec8408`) and convert it to a decimal number (ex: `82609160`) then add it to the list of Functions and commit the code.

```json
{
    "File": "Index.json",
    "Class": "Index",
    "Author": "tom@genius.com",
    "Purpose": "ðŸ–•",
    "Functions": [
        54270903
    ]
}
```
